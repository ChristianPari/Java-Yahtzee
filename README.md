# Yahtzee
This repo contains each version I create for a Java Yahtzee game, the end goal is to create a Full Stack App using Java, React, SpringBoot and a form of Database (unsure of which at the moment).

Currently within the `main` branch:<br>
A Console basic dice game that allows a user to roll a group of 5 dice and then with 3 turns either choose to re-roll a specific die or end their turn with what they have rolled.
