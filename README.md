# Yahtzee
This repo contains each version I create for a Java Yahtzee game, the end goal is to create a Full Stack App using Java, React, SpringBoot and a form of Database (unsure of which at the moment).

Currently within the `main` branch:<br>
A CLI program that allows multiple users to play a simple dice rolling game; 
basically initialize the game wih x amount of die that have x amount of sides, this is specified by the user from a prompt. 
Users play 13 rounds and have the option within their turn to roll a specified number of dice or end their turn if satisfied with their roll. 
Working on a fourth version that actually handles Yahtzee scoring...
